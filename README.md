# TimeToPractice
Hi. My name is Brad and I'm a student that wants to become a really good developer.  I don't really have a concrete idea 
  of how to do that yet but I know why I want to do that. Technology is the great equalizer. It allows people to live better 
  lives and makes the world a better place. I'm studying to be an engineer as my day job but want to learn computer science for
  fun and maybe become good enough to contribute to open source projects.
  
This project is just a way for me to practice programming. My goal is to become good but what constitutes good and how to get 
  there seems like a pretty highly debated topic. I'll do my best but be gentle and have a nice day.
